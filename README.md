# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 data using Tableau to provide insights into the spread, impact, and trends of the pandemic across WHO regions. The dashboard highlights critical metrics such as cumulative cases, deaths, and regional comparisons.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - A map showing COVID-19 case distribution by WHO region.
  - Bar and pie charts comparing cumulative cases and deaths across regions.
  - Filterable dashboard to focus on specific regions or metrics.
  
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Total cases and deaths per WHO region.
  - Comparative analysis of regions based on infection and mortality rates.
  - Graphical representation of cases vs. deaths for better insight.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Tableau Public**: Used to design and publish the dashboard.
- **Dataset Source**: The data was sourced from WHO reports or publicly available COVID-19 datasets. (Add the exact source link.)
- **Data Preparation**: The raw data was cleaned and formatted using [Excel/another tool if applicable].

## How to Access the Dashboard
1. Open the Tableau Public link to interact with the dashboard: [Insert Tableau Public Link].
2. Navigate through the visualizations to explore trends and insights.
3. Use the filters to focus on specific WHO regions or metrics.

## Insights
- **Africa and the Americas** show contrasting trends in cumulative cases and deaths.
- **Western Pacific** demonstrates unique patterns compared to other regions.
- Regional disparities in mortality rates highlight the pandemic's varied impact globally.
